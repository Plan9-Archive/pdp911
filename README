Readme for PDP911
==============================

PDP911 emulates a PDP-11/40 with a KW11-L line clock, a RK11 disk
controller and a KL11 serial console.  It expects 3 rk disks named
disk[012].rk in the current directory and will try to boot from the
first (see main.c:/^threadmain).  It serves a file system (/srv/pdp11
by default) and mounts it (to /mnt/pdp11 by default).  Attach to the
serial console with
	con -r /mnt/pdp11/con
and halt the emulation by writing "halt" to /mnt/pdp11/ctl

There is still much stuff to be implemented and probably quite a few
bugs.
