Readme for PDP911
==============================

PDP911 emulates a PDP-11/40 with a KW11-L line clock, a
RK11 disk controller and a KL11 serial console.  It expects 3 rk disks
named disk[012].rk in the current directory and will try to boot from
the first (see main.c:/^threadmain).  It posts the serial console as a
file descriptor to /srv/pdp11 that you can attach to with
	con -rl /srv/pdp11

There is still much stuff to be implemented and probably quite a few
bugs.
